Task: Price a binary option using Monte Carlo methodology. The following options were priced:

    Binary cash-or-nothing call and put option
    Binary asset-or-nothing call and put option

We further improved our model by using a Variance reduction technique (Antithetic Variate method) to improve accuracy, reduce standard and relative error and improve efficiency.
